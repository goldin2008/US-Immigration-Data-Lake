    "# US Immigration Data Lake\n",
    "### Data Engineering Capstone Project\n",
    "__Goal: To support U.S Customs & Border Protection Department to make better decisions on Immigration Policies__\n",
    "***\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "The purpose of this data engineering capstone project is to give students a chance to combine what they've learned throughout the program. This project will be an important part of learners portfolio that will help to achieve data engineering-related career goals. We could choose to complete the project provided by the Udacity team or define the scope and data ourselves. \n",
    "I took the first approach in building the Data Lake on the data on immigration to the United States provided by Udacity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Scenario\n",
    "A business consulting firm specialized in data warehouse services through assisting the enterprises with navigating their data needs and creating strategic operational solutions that deliver tangible business results is contacted by U.S Customs & Border Protection Department. Specifically, they want help with the modernization of department's data warehousing infrastructure by improving performance and ease of use for end users, enhancing functionality, decreasing total cost of ownership while making it possible for real-time decision making. In total, the department is asking for a full suite of services includes helping department with data profiling, data standardization, data acquisition, data transformation and integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Customs and Border Protection needs help to see what is hidden behind the data flood. The consulting firm aim to model and create a brand new analytics solution on top of the state-of-the-art technolgies available to enable department to unleash insights from data then making better decisions on immigration policies for those who came and will be coming in near future to the US.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Structure of the Project\n",
    "Following the Udacity guide for this project, the structure is as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Step 1: Scope the Project and Gather Data\n",
    "* Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data\n",
    "* Step 3: Define the Data Model\n",
    "* Step 4: Run ETL to Model the Data\n",
    "* Step 5: Complete Project Write Up"

    "_Explain what you plan to do in the project in more detail. What data do you use? What is your end solution look like? What tools did you use? etc_\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Scope\n",
    "The main deliverable of the work here will be a Data Lake in the cloud that will support answering questions through analytics tables and dashboards. Additionally, as a general source-of-truth database is developed, the U.S Customs & Border Protection Department could open the solution through a web API so backend web services could query the warehouse for information relating to international visitors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data\n",
    "For this work, the I-94 Immigration Dataset, the Global Temperature Dataset and U.S. City Demographic Dataset are used. \n",
    "The descriptions contained in the `I94_SAS_Labels_Descriptions.SAS` file is taken into account as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Architecture\n",
    "The whole solution is cloud based on top of __Amazon Web Services (AWS)__. First, all the datasets were preprocessed with __Apache Spark__ and stored in a staging area in __AWS S3__ bucket. Then, it is loaded into a __Amazon Redshift__ cluster using an __Apache Airflow__ pipeline that transfers and checks the quality of the data to finally provide the department a Data Lake for their convenient analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Architecture](images/architecture.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The main information and questions the department may want to extract from the Data Lake would be:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Immigrants by nationality.\n",
    "* Immigrants by origin.\n",
    "* Immigrants by airline.\n",
    "* Correlations between destination in the U.S and the source country.\n",
    "* Correlations between destination in the U.S and source climates.\n",
    "* Correlations between immigration by source region, and the source region temperature.\n",
    "* Correlations between Immigrants demographics, and states visited.\n",

    "## Step 2: Explore and Assess the Data\n",
    "***\n",
    "_To familiarize ourselves with the data provided by Udacity, the exhaustive exploratory data analysis ([EDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)) was performed to check what data would be useful and what preprocessing steps should be taken in order to clean, organize and join the various datasets in a meaningful data model._\n",

    "\n",
    "__Immigration Data__\n",
    "\n",
    "For decades, U.S. immigration officers issued the I-94 Form (Arrival/Departure Record) to foreign visitors (e.g., business visitors, tourists and foreign students) who lawfully entered the United States. The I-94 was a small white paper form that a foreign visitor received from cabin crews on arrival flights and from U.S. Customs and Border Protection at the time of entry into the United States. It listed the traveler's immigration category, port of entry, data of entry into the United States, status expiration date and had a unique 11-digit identifying number assigned to it. Its purpose was to record the traveler's lawful admission to the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the main dataset and there is a file for each month of the year of 2016 available in the directory `../../data/18-83510-I94-Data-2016/` in the [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/home.html) binary database storage format `sas7bdat`. Combined, the 12 datasets have got more than 40 million rows (40,790,529) and 28 columns. For most of the work, only the month of April of 2016 data is used which has more than three million records (3,096,313)."

    "The Berkeley Earth, which is affiliated with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, has repackaged the data from a newer compilation put it all together. The Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Study combines 1.6 billion temperature reports from 16 pre-existing archives. It is nicely packaged and allows for slicing into interesting subsets (for example by country). They publish the source data and the code for the transformations they applied. They also use methods that allow weather observations from shorter time series to be included, meaning fewer observations need to be thrown away.\n",

    "\n",
    "The whole solution implemented here is mounted on top of cloud computing technology, AWS in particular. Because the cloud computing provides a low-cost, scalable, and highly reliable infrastructure platform in the cloud this is a natural choice for every new solution like we did here. Every service we use (S3, Spark) has reasonable cost and is ‘pay as you go’ pricing. So we can start small and scale as our solution grows. No up-front costs involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, why we use the following services:\n",
    "\n",
    "__S3:__ Provides a relatively cheap, easy-to-use with scalability, high availability, security, and performance. This seems to be perfect to a staging area like our solution here;\n",
    "\n",
    "__Spark:__ This is simply the best framework for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing. Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance. Most of our team are pythonians and Spark has a very convenient API for python programmers to use;\n",

    "\n",

The US Cities Demographics data is updated every ten years according to https://www.usa.gov/statistics. So, the new US Cities Demographics data set maybe coming after year 2020. And may need updating after one year or two years as of 2019.\n",

    "\n",
    " * The data was increased by 100x:\n",
    " \n",
    "Deploy this Spark solution on a cluster using AWS (EMR cluster) and use S3 for data and parquet file storage. AWS will easily scale when data increases by 100x.\n",
    " \n",
    " * The data populates a dashboard that must be updated on a daily basis by 7am every day.\n",
    " \n",
    "Use Apache Airflow to schedule queries.\n",
    "\n",
